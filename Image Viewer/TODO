Purpose: The original purpose of this project was to develop a 
	batch cell counter for counting 'blobs' in various images.
	It allows the user to create an image filter line and specify
	blob count parameters for automated blob counting in images.

TODO for the Image Viewer

1. Create custom design for adding dynamic counting methods: i.e. max/min, 
	normal, different types of each, etc
2. CLEAN UP CODE, IT IS A MESS
	a. Note: step one should help with this greatly.
	b. The biggest mess is the file writing and reading code. It is really
		bad... it is just not very flexible.
3. Complete the Image Menu functionality.
	a. Split: creates 3 new images that are the red, green, and blue 
		layers of the original
	b. Join: Creates a new image with all the selected images piled
		on top of one another.
	c. Merge: Same as join except closes the source images.
