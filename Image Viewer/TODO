Purpose: The original purpose of this project was to develop a 
	batch cell counter for counting 'blobs' in various images.
	It allows the user to create an image filter line and specify
	blob count parameters for automated blob counting in images.

TODO for the Image Viewer

1. Complete the Image Menu functionality.
	a. Split: creates 3 new images that are the red, green, and blue 
		layers of the original
	b. Join: Creates a new image with all the selected images piled
		on top of one another.
	c. Merge: Same as join except closes the source images.
