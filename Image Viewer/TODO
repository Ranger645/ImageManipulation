Purpose: The original purpose of this project was to develop a 
	batch cell counter for counting 'blobs' in various images.
	It allows the user to create an image filter line and specify
	blob count parameters for automated blob counting in images.

TODO for the Image Viewer

1. Create batch operations menu
	a. Add command for counting cells in all files with the given
		filter and blob count params.
	b. store blob counts neatly in a csv file.
2. Research what commands need to be done on the raw rd2 files in
	imageJ so you know what to do
3. Write a script that can convert folder of rd2 files and perform
	proper operations on them from (2) and store them in a target
	folder.
4. Add support for this script to be called in this project.
5. Make sure project contains all resources for operating imageJ in
	its root directory.
