Purpose: The original purpose of this project was to develop a 
	batch cell counter for counting 'blobs' in various images.
	It allows the user to create an image filter line and specify
	blob count parameters for automated blob counting in images.
	
1. Get the assisted batch count function ready for a real user by:
	a. Graying out buttons that should not be used at certain times
	b. Adding progress bar integration
	c. Make sure if an error occurs when opening a file, it doesn't panic.
		i) Make sure it alerts the user
		ii) make sure it doesn't corrupt any already counted data.
	c. Test with real data.
	d. Still have count update problem when a layer is not viewed.
2. Complete the Image Menu functionality.
	a. Split: creates 3 new images that are the red, green, and blue 
		layers of the original
	b. Join: Creates a new image with all the selected images piled
		on top of one another.
	c. Merge: Same as join except closes the source images.
